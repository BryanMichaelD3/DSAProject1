# DSAProject1

This Java program reads in a csv file of names and phone numbers then allows a reverse lookup of a name based on a phone number that the user inputs. It stores the names and phone numbers in a linked list that holds both the first three digits of a phone number and another linked list of all contacts corresponding to those first three digits of the number. Each contact consists of a name and the last four digits of their phone number.
